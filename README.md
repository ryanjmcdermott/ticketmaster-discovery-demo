# Ticketmaster Discovery Demo

This project was built using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and the [Ticketmaster Discovery REST API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/). The primarly purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of REST APIs within a React app. 

*It's worth noting that the appearance, as of writing, has not been taken into account since functionality and performance were the main concern. I may come back in the future to pretty things up, but as of now, this site is my ugly child.*

## Secondary Technologies Used

- [`react-paginate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate) was used for pagination of the homepage event view.
- [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/icons) was used for the arrows in the pagination.
- [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for the minimal styling included.
